I am currently pursuing an academic Master's Degree in pedagogy (specialization: EdTech) at Normal College, Qingdao University, advised by [Professor Xinghua Wang](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=IGn7oooAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Before this, I worked as a full-time university counsellor at Student Affairs Department of Qingdao University for two years. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, also from Qingdao University.

My research focuses on the effectiveness of social robots in enhancing children's development across affective, behavioral, cognitive, and social domains. Furthermore, I delve into the teacher's AI readiness and the dark side of information and communication technologies (i.e., technostress) in education. In addition, I use Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) technology to explore the internal brain mechanisms underlying children's cognitive and affective development as they engage with AI.
